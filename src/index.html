There are no random people in aviation, and men with strong hands and good hearts never leave orphans alone. The foundling was called Mansur - in the Altai dialect it means bear. The surname was given in honor of the airfield - Orlovsky. The bear almost instantly turned into the epicenter of the life of the airfield - everyone came to hug it, shake it's leather paw, pat behind the ear. Mansur still had a sucking reflex, he loved to slap his outstretched palm, childishly clasp the one who came up behind his knees.

That was the reason why some educational conversations took place at that time. - We understood that at the moment it is something between a child and a puppy. But time will fly quickly, and, frankly speaking, the place of the bear is in the forest, - recognizes Andrew. - But just like that, let go Mansur into the forest - send him to certain death.
